Replace the basic "Most used tags" with a fast, searchable, sortable tag selector modal.

== Description ==
Enhanced Tag Selector replaces the default "Choose from the most used tags" with a modern selector that makes working with many tags easy.

Features:
- Sort by Most Used, Least Used, A–Z, Z–A
- Live search with debounce for quick filtering
- Prevents duplicates by hiding already-selected tags
- Clean, responsive UI that fits the WordPress admin
- Translation-ready with included locales (el, es_ES, fr_FR, de_DE)

Perfect for sites with large tag libraries or editors who need speed and clarity.
